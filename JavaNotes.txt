26-2-24***Constructor***

>Constructor in java is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object 

>Java Constructor is invoked at the time of object creation. It construct the value i.e provide data for the object that is why it is known as constructors

Rules for constructor

2 basic rule

>Constructor name must be same as its class name
>Constructor must have no explicit return type

Type of constructor

2 type 

1>Default Constructor (no aurgument constructor)
2>Parameterized constructor

27-2-2023***Java And Polymorphism

>Java Provides mutliple forms of polymorphism.it allows you to define the same method name to do multiple different things.It also....

Type of Polymorphism

>2 types
>1.Compile time polymorphism (static Polymorphism)
>2.Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism)    

>Encapsulation

28-2-24************Inheritance

In java Inheritance is a mechanism which one object can get allthe properties and behavoirs of a parent object.In inheritance there is a relationship between twocclasses;
that's why it IS-A relationship.
for example:bike, car bus this are vehicle.That's why the child of vehivle are bike car bus and vehicke is the parent of this object

>java Inheritance
..
Inheritance Syntax:

class Parent
{
//code
}

class Child extends Parent
{
//code
}

>Type of Inheritance
-Single Inheritance
-Multiple Inheritance
-Multi-level Inheritance
-Hierarchical Inheritance
-Hybrid Inheritance

--------------------------------------------interface

*An interface in java is a blue print of a class it has static constant and abstract methods
*THe interface in java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction
*there can be only abstract methods in the java interface not method body.it is used to achieve abstraction and mutiple inheritance in java.
*Java Interface also represents IS-A relationship.
---Why use Java Interface?

>There are mainly



21-3-2024*Thread
Introduction to thread
Process and thread are basic units of java program execution.
>Process:A process is a self contained execution environment and it can be seen as a program or application.
>Thread:It can be called Lightweight process
	>Thread requires less resources to create and exist in the process
	>Thread Shared the process
*Multithreading in java
Multithreading in java is a process of execution mutliple processes simultaneously
>A program is divided into two or more subprogram which can be implemented at the same time in parallel.
>Multiprocessing and Multithreading, both are used to achive multitasking 
>java Multithreading is mostly used in games,animation etc...

craeting threads 

-threads are implemnented in the form of objects..
-the run() and start() are two inbuiltr methods which helps to thread implemention 
 - the run () method is the heart and soul of any thread
			-it makes up the entire body of a thread
-the run() method can be initating with the help of start() method.

creating thread contd..

1.by Extending athread  class

class multi extends thraed


26/3/24
String getName()--Retrives The name of running thread in the current context in string Format
void start()---this method will start a new thread of excution by calling run() method of thread /runnable object..
----incomplit---
